    We will talk about introspection features of Ruby interpreter (MRI) to solve troubles on your Ruby on Rails application. Rails application development with Ruby is basically fast and easy. However, when you have trouble such as tough bugs in your app, performance issues and memory consumption issues, they are difficult to solve without tooling. In this presentation, I will show you what kind of introspection features MRI has and how to use them with your Rails application.

    Performance regressions in edge Rails versions happen quite often, and are sometimes introduced even by experienced Core commiters. The Rails team doesn’t have any tools to get notified about this kind of regressions yet. This is why I’ve built RailsPerf, a regression detection tool for Rails. It resembles a continuous integration service in a way: it runs benchmarks after every commit in Rails repo to detect any performance regressions. I will speak about building a right set of benchmarks, isolating build environments, and I will also analyze some performance graphs for major Rails versions

    RSpec is often described with the word “magic” by both its users and its detractors.

    Understanding how RSpec matchers, doubles, and specifications work will help you as an RSpec user. You will be able to take advantage of RSpec’s flexibility to make your tests clearer and more expressive. You’ll also get some exposure to new RSpec features, like compound matchers.

    Walking through a typical RSpec example, we’ll show the RSpec internals as RSpec evaluates matchers and uses doubles. You’ll leave with a better understanding of how to harness RSpec in your own tests.

    Every interview you conduct is bi-directional and creating a bad candidate experience means you'll fail to hire the team that you want to work on – you can't hire great people with a mediocre hiring process. The experts in this session have analyzed thousands of interviews and will share how to create a great candidate experience in your company and how to scale your teams effectively. Candidates can use these same lessons to prepare for interviews and evaluate the companies interviewing them.

    Rails apps start out quickly and beautifully, but after a year features are a struggle, tests are slow, developers are grinding, and stakeholders are unhappy. "Skinny controllers and fat models" hasn't worked, and "use service objects!" is awfully vague.

    This talk explains how to compact the "big ball of mud" at the heart of your app into a bedrock of reliable code. It gives the steps to incrementally refactor models into a functional core and gives explicit rules for how to write light, reliable tests.

    Every week we hear news of another security breach. We’ve learned that retailers aren’t safe from their HVAC vendors, Seth Rogen can stir an international cybersecurity incident, and not even the venerable OpenSSL can be trusted.

    If you're concerned about the security of your Rails app but don't feel like you can spare the time or effort to implement two factor authentication, this talk is for you. We'll discuss the best ways to protect your users' accounts and live code the integration of two factor authentication into your Rails app in less than 15 minutes using Authy.

    User Centered Design as a process is almost thirty years old now. The philosophy has permeated our products and the way we build our interfaces. But this philosophy is rarely extended to the code we write. We'll take a look at some principles of UX and Interface Design and relate them back to our code. By comparing code that gets it right to code that gets it desperately wrong, we'll learn some principles that we can use to write better, more usable code.

    Code reviews are not about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about socialization, learning, and teaching.

    How can you get the most out of a peer's code review and how can you review code without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a better teammate.

    You will leave this talk with the tools to implement a successful code-review culture. You'll learn how to get more from the reviews you're already getting and how to have more impact with the reviews you leave.

    As a software developer, I can adopt methodologies so that I feel there's a sense of order in the world.

    There's a problem with this story: We are humans, developing software with humans, to benefit humans. And humans are messy.

    We wrap ourselves in process, trying to trade people for personas, points, planning poker, and the promise of predictability. Only people aren't objects to be abstracted away. Let's take some time to think through the trade offs we're making together.

    Fostering diversity is a commonly cited goals for the tech community, and - let's be honest - the liberal arts are kicking our butts at it. This was not always the case, though; until very recently, the faces of the liberal arts were exclusively white and male. This changed thanks to distinct strategies and deliberate cultural shifts brought about in the late 20th century, some of which the tech community has copied and others we can use more effectively. In this talk, we will explore some of those strategies by examining the education, history, and culture of the liberal arts.

    Like most programmers I am lazy. I don't want to do something by hand if I can automate it. I also think DevOps can be dreadfully dull. Luckily there are now tools that support lazy DevOps. I'll demonstrate how using Docker containers and Kubernetes allows you to be lazy and get back to building cool features (or watching cat videos). I'll go over some of the pros and cons to the "lazy" way and I'll show how these tools can be used by both simple and complex apps.

    Like an espresso, code is better served in small portions. Unfortunately most of the time we build systems consisting of a monolithic application that gets bigger and scarier by the day. Fortunately there are a few ways to solve this problem.

    Everyone talks about how good microservices are. At a first glance an architecture of small independently deployable services seems ideal, but it's no free lunch, it comes with some drawbacks.

    In this talk we'll see how microservices help us think differently about writing code and solving problems, and why they are not always the right answer.

    Modern distributed systems have aggressive requirements around uptime and performance, they need to face harsh realities such as sudden rush of visitors, network issues, tangled databases and other unforeseen bugs.

    With so many moving parts involved even in the simplest of services, it becomes mandatory to adopt defensive patterns which would guard against some of these problems and identify anti-patterns before they trigger cascading failures across systems.

    This talk is for all those developers who hate getting a oncall at 4 AM in the morning.

    Many people assume that the only way to add interesting charts and visualizations to their web applications is via JavaScript. But this isn't true. You don't need a 900 kB JavaScript library to generate simple charts. Instead you can use SVG and Ruby. Once you learn how to build your own SVG graphics then it's possible to do cool things like cache them, or use your own CSS and JavaScript to manipulate them. This presentation will show you how.

To catch these problems, we manually check every page on our site, which is a slow and error-prone approach. We need a better way to test our CSS.

    When we want to offer customizability to the users of our applications, things can get tricky. How do we allow users to customize the look of the user interface while reusing the static CSS we’ve already designed?

    There is a way, but it is fraught with many dangers. Learn about the power of dynamically generating CSS from Sass files. Tackle the foes of dynamic content injection, rendering, caching, and background processing. In the end, we will look triumphantly at our ability to reuse our application styles to create customizable interfaces for our end users.

    While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB while still integrating closely with Rails. We could now separate presentation logic from display structure; reason about our views and how they relate; and dramatically improve our code. We called the library Curly, and it's pretty awesome.

    We talk about bringing new developers "up to speed quickly." Imposter syndrome is bad enough, but often junior developers feel pressured to learn faster and produce more. Developers often focus on velocity as the critical measure of success. The need for speed actually amplifies insecurities, magnifies imposter syndrome, and hinders growth. Instead let's talk about how we can track and plan progress using meaningful goals and metrics.

    How does a Ruby debugger look and work on the inside? Is it difficult to write a debugger? Hear the full story of supporting Ruby 2.0 straight from the maintainer of the RubyMine debugger. In this session we'll expose debugger internals, including different APIs used by debuggers; review how they evolved; and look at what it takes to keep the performance of a debugged application at a reasonable level. We'll also talk about alternative implementations including JRuby and Rubinius.

    When a Fortune 500 company wants to use your app but can't risk sharing sensitive data in the cloud, you'll need to package and deploy an autonomous version of it behind their firewall (aka the Fog). We’ll explore some methods to make this possible including standalone VM provisioning, codebase security, encrypted package distribution, seat based licensing and code updates.

    React is the best way to bring interactive UIs to your Rails apps. But using React.js on Rails can be hard. NPM libraries are difficult to include, JSX seems nonsensical, and “can we still use CoffeeScript?”

    There’s not one obvious path for working with React.js on Rails. In this talk, we’ll review the sordid past of Rails and JavaScript, explore the complementarity of React and Rails, and navigate the woes of integrating with NPM. We’ll discover why React is a natural fit for Rails today and how to make Rails love React in the future.

    With the "Path to 2.0" CFP EmberCLI was and is projected to become a first class citizen in the Ember world. And there was much joy. However, it placed a question mark on the Rails integration story. First we had globals, then ember-rails, then Ember App Kit. Just as a bead was being drawn on the proper way... EmberCLI. EmberCLI Rails is a new gem which facilitates an integration story we can love.

    Full stack testing (no "Air gap")
    simple installation
    Sustainability
    Configurable setup
    Potential for simple deployments
    Let's learn how easy integration can be.

    Rails and the ActiveRecord gem are really handy tools to get work done, and do it quickly. They aren't a silver bullet, though. Sometimes the database is the best place to run a complicated query. Especially when you have big transactional or time-series data. Databases are also incredibly powerful, and can do remarkable things at scale. Why not take advantage of that power?

    This talk will discuss some of the things that you can do with PostgreSQL that will both blow your mind and also help you transform data into knowledge. Let's have some fun playing with data together!

    Typical Rails applications have database schemas that are designed for on-line transaction processing. But when the data volumes grow then they are not well suited for effective data analysis. You probably need a data warehouse and specialized data analysis tools for that. This presentation will cover * an introduction to a data warehouse and multi-dimensional schema design, * comparison of traditional and analytical databases, * extraction, transformation and load (ETL) of data, * On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools, Mondrian OLAP engine in particular and how to use it from Ruby.

    We had a real-time API in Rails that needed much lower latency and massive throughput. We wanted to preserve our investment in business logic inside ActiveRecord models while scaling up to 1000X throughput and cutting latency in half. Conventional wisdom would say this was impossible in Ruby, but we succeeded and actually surpassed our expectations. We'll discuss how we did it, using Event-Machine for the reactor pattern, Synchrony to avoid callback hell and to make testing easy, Goliath as the non-blocking web server, and sharding across many cooperative processes.

Why? We developers are lazy and you're making it hard for us to use. We're diving into your SDKs tests to solve basic tasks, your SDK + API errors annoy and don't help us fix our mistakes, and the lack of logical defaults leaves us playing parameter roulette.

    What actually happens when we visit a website? As developers, we're supposed to know all about this, but when our browsers have millions of lines of code, and our backends have fancy service-oriented-architectures with dozens of components, it's hard to keep it all in our heads.

    Fortunately, we have amazing tools to help us. We can bypass the complexity of browsers and servers, and simply examine the communication between them. Let's use these tools and look at the underlying patterns shared across the entire web, from the simplest static pages to the most sophisticated web apps.

    A lot of people have being using Rails to develop both their internal or external API, but building a high quality API can be hard, and performance is a key point to achieve it.

    I'll share my stories with APIs, and tell you how Active Model Serializer, component of Rails-API, helped me. AMS have being used across thousands of applications bringing convention over configuration to JSON generation.

    This talk will give you a sneak peek of a new version of AMS that we have being working on, it's new cache conventions, and how it's being considered to be shipped by default in new Rails 5.

    You grok SOLID. You practice TDD. You've read Sandi's book…twice. You rewatch Destroy All Software monthly. You can pronounce GOOS. You know your stuff!

    But some of your coworkers say your code is too complex or confusing for them. You might rush to conclude that must be a them problem.

    But doubt lingers: what if they're right?

    After all, the more thought we put into a bit of code, the more information that code carries. Others must extract that embedded meaning, either by careful reading or shared experience. Sometimes boring code is better. Let's figure out when to be dull.

    For developers, there are two things that are certain for time zones: you can’t avoid having to deal with them, and you will screw them up at some point. There are, however, some ways to mitigate the pain. This talk will discuss tactics for avoiding time zone mayhem, using a feature to send out weekly email reports in a customer’s local time zone as a case study. It will cover idiosyncrasies of how time zones are handled in Ruby and Rails, how to write tests to avoid false positives, and advice on how to release time zone-related code changes more safely.

    In Rails 5, the old way of returning false to implicitly halt a callback chain will not work anymore.

    This change will impact any codebase using ActiveSupport, ActiveRecord, ActiveModel or ActiveJob.

    Methods like before_action, before_save, before_validation will require developers to explicitly throw an exception in order the halt the chain.

    This talk will explain the motivations behind the new default, will delve into the internals of Rails to show the actual code, and will help developers and gem maintainers safely upgrade their apps to Rails 5.

    With projects like Doorkeeper, OAuth has pretty solid support in Rails when dealing with one application. However, when Rails applications get larger, many project teams break up their monolithic application into services. Some suggest installing Doorkeeper on every service, whereas others recommend routing all traffic through a single service.

    Recently, we worked on a project where neither of these solutions seemed right. Join us as we talk about our experience in federating OAuth in order to handle over 30,000 concurrent users.

    Ruby is a productive language that developers love. When Ruby isn't fast enough, they often fall back to writing C extensions. But C extensions are scary for a number of reasons; it's easy to leak memory, or segfault the entire process. When we started to look at writing parts of the Skylight agent using native code, Rust was still pretty new, but its promise of low-level control with high-level safety intrigued us. We'll cover the reasons we went with Rust, how we structured our code, and how you can do it too. If you're looking to expand your horizons, Rust may be the language for you.

    So you are building an app that has a ton of forms each with tons of fields. Your heart sinks as you think of writing and managing all those models, migrations and associations. PostgreSQL JSON column and ActiveRecord::Store to the rescue! This talk covers a way to wrap these Rails 4 features to simplify the building of extensive hierarchical data models. You will learn to expressively declare schema-less attributes on your model that act much like “real" columns, meaning they are typecast, validated, query able, embeddable, and behave with Rails form builders.

    Developers are trained to communicate to things with a goal in mind. When you're talking to something like, say a computer, you type in your code and it responds by giving you back what you want. Simple and straight-forward. Talking to humans? That's more of a challenge. Why? Because communicating with people requires a special set of skills - namely, empathy and a little bit of storytelling. In an industry filled with brilliant minds, great ideas and mass disruption, so few of the best and brightest know how to tell their compelling story. This workshop will teach you how.

The technology to make contextual communications is evolving quickly with exciting technologies like WebRTC, speech recognition and natural language processing.

    Payments applications typically require a strong audit trail, very predictable failure behavior and strong transactional integrity. In Ruby/Rails, ActiveRecord allows any part of the code to modify anything in the database, failures are often silently ignored, and database transactions are hidden for convenience by default. In this talk I'll explore how to solve those problems and use RoR to build a large scale payments system.

Could it be one of the gems I am using? Did I do something wrong? In this session, we will look at some tips, tricks and tools to help you debug your Rails issues. Along the way, you will also learn how to dive into the Rails codebase without getting lost. The next time you a mysterious bug finds its way into your Rails applications, you will be well-equipped to pry open the black box yourself!

    When you want to talk to someone, where do you turn? Skype? Slack or HipChat? Maybe even an old-fashioned telephone? As great (or not) as these are, they all fail in one important way: Context. As developers, why don’t we enable our users to communicate where they are doing everything else, right inside the browser or mobile app? The technology to make contextual communications is evolving quickly with exciting technologies like WebRTC, speech recognition and natural language processing. This talk is about how to apply those building blocks and bring contextual communication to your apps.

    The most useful APIs are simple and composeable. Omnipotent DSLs can be great, but sometimes we want to just write Ruby. We're going to look at the process of designing a new API for attributes and type casting in Rails 5.0, and why simpler is better. We'll unravel some of the mysteries behind the internals of Active Record. After all, Rails is ultimately just a large legacy code base. In this talk you'll learn about the process of finding those simple APIs which are begging to be extracted, and the refactoring process that can be used to tease them out slowly.

    Developers often refer to their trade as both “art” and “craft," using the two interchangeably. Yet, the terms traditionally refer to different ends of the creative spectrum. So what is code? Art or craft?

    Come explore these questions in this interdisciplinary talk: What is art versus craft? How does coding fit in once we make this distinction? Is the metaphor we use to describe coding even important––and why? You’ll walk away from this discussion with a better understanding of what creating and programming means to you, and what it could mean to others.

    Our code is full of hidden assumptions, things that seem like nothing, secrets that we did not name and thus cannot see. These secrets represent missing concepts and this talk shows you how to expose those concepts with code that is easy to understand, change and extend. Being explicit about hidden ideas makes your code simpler, your apps clearer and your life better. Even very small ideas matter. Everything, even nothing, is something.

    Applications today are spidery and include thousands of possible optimization points. No matter how deep performance testing data are, developers are still at a loss when asked to derive meaningful and actionable data that pinpoint to bottlenecks in the application. You know things are slow, but you are left with the challenge of figuring out where to optimize. This presentation describes a new kind of analytics, called performance analytics, that provide tangible ways to root cause performance problems in today’s applications and clearly identify where and what to optimize.

    We all run into legacy code. Sometimes, we even write it ourselves. Working with legacy code can be a daunting challenge, but there are ways to tackle it without taking on the risk of a full rewrite.

    There is a deep satisfaction that comes from conquering a nasty piece of legacy code. The ability to achieve this goal depends on both testing and refactoring.

    We'll learn how baby-step refactoring techniques lead to a better understanding of the code and a high-quality design while always keeping the code running.

Right incantations (which is to say, scenarios and sample code) for battling this devious tendency will be presented, with all magic (that is, “buzz”) words thoroughly demystified and clearly explained. Walk away with a new understanding of why your application tables deserve indexes from day one, and how to make sure you’ve got them covered.

    Capybara has allowed us to build complex and ambitious applications with the confidence that everything comes together in the user experience we're targeting. As the capabilities of the web have grown, interactions and behavior in our applications have become more complex and harder to test. Our tests become coupled to CSS selectors, fail intermittently, take longer and our confidence dwindles. In this talk, I'll go over best practices for working with a large Capybara test suite and dig into APIs and options we can use to handle complex apps such as a chat app not written in Ruby.
